# Tweet @MEET Lab 5: Handling forms

### 1. Exercises

#### Exercise 1

In `app.py`, add code in `edit_tweet` where it says `# MISSING CODE HERE FOR UPDATING THE TWEET` that updates the database, changing the tweet to have the new text, picture_url, show_location, and location provided.

#### Exercise 2

In `app.py`, modify your code for `add_tweet` and `delete_tweet` so that they can add and delete tweets from the database and then redirect the user back to the page that views all tweets.

#### Exercise 3

In `templates/edit_tweet.html`, make it so that the "edit tweet" page automatically selects the `show_location` value of the tweet when you load the webpage.
